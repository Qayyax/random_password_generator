It is a project given by **Scrimba** on their **Front end career path** online bootcamp. 

## What I learnt

- I learnt how to use the line break feature to separate heading in `HTML`
- I learnt how to use while loop even though it had not been thought yet.
- I learnt how to convert array to string with the `.join()` function which was used to remove `,` in the password.
- I used Github desktop for the first time also; I mostly use the terminal to commit and push to GitHub.
